Soils are usually medium to fine in texture. Significant additions of water by subsurface flow are necessary in coarse-textured soils. Some horizons may remain wet for as long as one week after water addition."^^xsd:string ;

Seasonal ponding, resulting from runon and insufficient outfall, also occurs. A perched water table may be present. Soils have a wide range in texture and depth; many have horizons that are gleyed, mottled, or possess orange or rusty linings of root channels. All horizons remain wet for periods of several months."^^xsd:string ;

  rdf:type skos:Concept ;
  dct:description "Water is removed from the soil so slowly that the water table remains at or near the surface for most of the year. Surface flow, groundwater and subsurface flow are major sources of water, although precipitation may be important where there is a perched water table and precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration. Soils have a wide range in texture and depth, and often occur in depressed sites. Strong gleying and accumulation of surface organic matter are usually features of most soils."^^xsd:string ;
