Horizons with few (2–10%) or very few (<2%) segregations are not usually given these horizon notations. This suffix indicates relative accumulations compared with other horizons. Thus in a soil with no carbonate except for one horizon with few segregations, this horizon could be designated with a suffix ‘k’, for example B22tk. However, in a soil with few segregations of carbonate throughout, no horizon would be given the suffix ‘k’ unless it had common or more segregations, that is, a relatively larger amount than adjacent horizons." ;

The rate of transmission of water in the profile is based on the assumption that loss by evapotranspiration is minimal.
