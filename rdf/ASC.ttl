  dcterms:description """These soils result from human activities which have caused a profound modification, mixing, truncation or burial of the original soil horizons, or the creation of new soil parent materials. Note that the concept of soil used in this classification of Australian soils (see Background) also applies to the Anthroposols, and hence sealed and semi-sealed surfaces such as streets, roads etc. are regarded as 'non-soil'. Also, in depositional situations, the anthropic material must be 0.3 m or more thick where it overlies buried soils. A soil with anthropic materials less than 0.3 m thick should be classified as an anthropic phase of the underlying soil.

To qualify as soil an Anthroposol needs to possess some pedogenic features, as noted below. Key criteria in the identification of an Anthroposol are the presence of artefacts in the profile or knowledge that the soils or their parent materials have been made or altered by human action.

Anthroposols differ from other soils in that we normally know their origin with a degree of certainty, and hence we can invoke a knowledge of process rather than defined pedogenic attributes to initially classify the soil. We can then subdivide at the higher levels on the basis of type of process and nature of the product which forms the parent material of the new soil. At lower levels in the classification, conventional soil properties could be used when available, although obviously these will be limited in very young soils.""" ;
  dcterms:identifier "http://anzsoil.org/def/au/asc/AN"^^xsd:anyURI ;
  rdfs:comment """It is difficult to quantify ‘profound modification, mixing and truncation’ but this would normally exclude the usual agricultural operations (including land planning) which may change a soil from say a Chromosol to a Dermosol by mixing or removal of the upper horizons. Similarly, soils that are artificially drained or flooded are not Anthroposols but may classify as different soil orders following a permanent change in water status (see also comment in Hydrosols).

There will be instances where the question is how much truncation results in ‘profound modification’ or merely a truncated phase. It is difficult to give guidelines that will cover all circumstances, and inevitably judgement is required. Similarly, there will be instances where land reclamation and restoration in the past have been so successful that little evidence of a prior disturbance remains, and soil development gives no clue to past history. A good example of this is Podosol development on restored and revegetated coastal dunes following sand mining.""" ;
  skos:definition "Soils resulting from human activities which have led to a profound modification, truncation or burial of the original soil horizons, or the creation of new soil parent materials by a variety of mechanical means. Where burial of a pre-existing soil is involved, the anthropic materials must be 0.3 m or more thick. Pedogenic features may be the result of in situ processes (usually the minimal development of an A1 horizon, sometimes the stronger development of typical soil horizons) or the result of pedogenic processes prior to modification or placement (ie. the presence of identifiable pre-existing soil material)." ;

  rdfs:comment """A difficulty may arise in separating those Calcarosols that are not calcareous throughout from calcareous Kandosols and from Tenosols containing pedogenic carbonate. However, in the latter two soils it is usual for the carbonate to occur in the lower part of the B horizon, and not immediately below the A horizon. Even so, transitional cases will arise where it becomes a matter of judgement as to which order the particular soil is best placed. Similar transitions might occur between shallow Calcarosols and Arenic Rudosols overlying a layer of calcrete or limestone. Again, Calcareous Arenic Rudosols will occur where recent aeolian calcareous material has been deposited.

In landscapes dominated by wind-blown calcareous material it may be difficult to determine if the carbonates are of pedogenic origin. Deep calcareous sands, which commonly occur in this situation, are now included in the Arenosols order.

Soils with minimal soil development and dominated by coarse fragments of shells or other aquatic animals are included in Shelly Rudosols.

In dune landscapes, where these soils frequently occur, it is common to find evidence of post-European settlement deflation and layering of soil profiles caused by wind erosion and consequent deposition. Unless the surface depositional material is 0.3 m or more thick, it is ignored in the classification and treated as a phase. (see 'What do we classify?').""" ;

  dcterms:description """This order is designed to accommodate a range of seasonally or permanently wet soils and thus there is some diversity within the order. The key criterion is saturation of the major part of the soil profile for prolonged periods (2-3 months) in most years. Some Hydrosols are permanently submerged. The soils may or may not experience reducing conditions for all or part of the period of saturation, and thus manifestations of reduction and oxidation such as gley colours and ochrous mottles may or may not be present.

Saturation by a water table may not necessarily be caused by low soil permeability. Often site drainage will be the most important factor, while in other well-known cases tidal influence is dominant. The relevant Field Handbook drainage classes are very poorly and poorly drained.

Several major classes of soils are excluded because it is considered their other profile characteristics are of greater significance than wetness. These are the Organosols, Podosols and Vertosols. Although some Hydrosols are dominated by organic materials (see Intertidal Hydrosols below), it is thought that because of their unique nature (ie. largely consisting of mangrove debris that is regularly inundated by saline tidal waters), it is more appropriate to classify them as an organic form of Hydrosols rather than as a class of Organosols that occur in a mangrove environment.""" ;
  dcterms:identifier "http://anzsoil.org/def/au/asc/HY"^^xsd:anyURI ;
  rdfs:comment """The approach taken in this concept of 'wet' soils differs from more traditional usage in that reducing conditions are not emphasised. The rationale for the present approach is based on the assumption that saturation affects soil properties irrespective of whether or not reducing conditions are present. Obvious examples are those relating to certain physical and engineering properties, which result in limitations to the use of a soil eg. trafficability, etc.

A further reason for not making reducing conditions mandatory is the well-known difficulty in identifying such conditions, which are often of a temporal nature and sporadic in spatial distribution. It is widely recognised that the traditional use of gley colours and particular kinds of mottling are not universally indicative of a saturated condition or its duration. In particular, mottles or other segregations can be relict. Another problem in identification of reducing conditions, is the experience that various indicator dyes such as α,α-dipyridyl (Childs & Clayden 1986) may be unreliable.

It will also be apparent that the concept adopted for Hydrosols will normally exclude the pseudo (or surface water) gley class commonly distinguished in several European classification schemes. These soils have a perched water table usually caused by a slowly permeable horizon or layer within the soil profile.

A difficult question arises as to how artificially drained soils are best treated. In many cases drainage will merely lower the water table to depths which permit the successful growth of particular plants. Such depths may still be relatively shallow eg. 0.5 - 1 m, and capillary rise may result in wet soil conditions to variable heights above the new water table. Additionally, the topographic situation and/or the climatic environment may mean that drainage merely reduces the period of saturation. If drainage is such that saturation no longer occurs for appropriate periods in the relevant parts of the profile, the soil can strictly no longer be considered a Hydrosol. Possibly a 'drained' phase may be appropriate in some such circumstances.

In the case of irrigated soils, the main example is when more or less permanent flood irrigation is employed to grow rice. This would be expected to change, for example, a Chromosol to a Chromosolic Hydrosol. It should be noted that the definition of the order is deliberately somewhat equivocal in that the duration and frequency of saturation of a precise section of the profile are not specifically defined. Lack of water table data is one reason, but it is also thought that a degree of flexibility is required for the definition. It is recognised that the extent of soil wetness can seldom be assessed by a single inspection of a particular site. However, in the author's experience judicious questioning of people with local knowledge, together with the soil scientist's assessment of soil and site drainage and climatic environment, can usually achieve a satisfactory resolution of the problem.""" ;

Reclassification may also be required for other sandy soils where deep examination below 1.0 m reveals deep more clayey B horizons. See How to Classify for assistance with determining whether the layer is a B or D horizon. If the layer is a D horizon, the soil remains classified as an Arenosol.

Bleached or Grey Arenosols are distinguished from Podosols by the absence of Podosol diagnostic horizons. These horizons can occur below 1.0 m deep and commonly at considerable depth. If no deep examination has been done in similar soils in similar environments, then the soil should classify as a Bleached or Grey Arenosol with a confidence level of 4.

  rdfs:comment """There is convincing evidence from the Riverine Plain of south eastern Australia that soils with sodic clay B horizons (ESP 25-30) which are strongly subplastic behave very differently in terms of permeability to the more commonly found plastic sodic clay B horizons which are characterised by low to very low saturated hydraulic conductivity (McIntyre 1979). It is on this basis that subplastic sodic soils are excluded from Sodosols, because of their very different land use properties.

Strongly acid sodic soils are also excluded from Sodosols because they usually contain appreciable exchangeable aluminium (KCl extractable) and thus should be unlikely to disperse.

It is usually possible to assess, in the field, the likelihood of a soil possessing a sodic B2t horizon. Such a criterion as the presence of a bleached A2 horizon with an abrupt change to a B2t horizon which has columnar or prismatic structure is a useful but not universal guide. A high pHw value (>8.5) suggests sodicity, but the converse is not true. The soapy nature of the bolus produced in field texturing will also often suggest appreciable sodium (and/or magnesium) on the clay exchange complex.

Increasing experience in many parts of Australia is confirming that the Emerson dispersion test (Emerson 1967) and the modified version of Loveday and Pyle (1973) is a reliable guide to sodicity. It can be carried out as a preliminary test in the field, but should always be repeated under the better controlled conditions of the laboratory. In the initial test at least several fragments (each about 0.2 g or about 4 -5 mm diameter) are immersed in 100 ml of distilled water. The large water:soil ratio is necessary to remove any salt present in the aggregate. Also for this reason Emerson (1991) suggests that the classification for each test be made after 24 hours. For the remoulded test, use a 5 mm cube which can be obtained from the bolus used for determining field texture. This will be approximately in the plastic limit condition. Note that distilled water should be used to prepare the bolus.

Data from Loveday and Pyle (1973) and unpublished data available to the original author Ray Isbell suggest that a dispersive soil will usually indicate sodicity, ie. ESP of 6 or greater. The data of Murphy (1995) indicate that whereas Emerson class 1 and the more strongly dispersive soils of class 2 are a reliable indicator of sodicity, whereas class 3 is a more variable predictor. Emerson classes of 5 or greater or a Loveday and Pyle score of zero strongly suggest soils are non-sodic. There is less evidence that the dispersion tests give a reliable indication of the degree of sodicity; factors such as extent of initial slaking and initial salt content in the aggregates, and the amount of magnesium and amount and form of aluminium on the exchange complex (Emerson 1994), can also influence the rapidity of dispersion. Nevertheless, the data of Loveday and Pyle measuring dispersion after 2 hours and 20 hours showed that the rate of dispersion could be used as a guide to ESP. This relationship does not apply to the subplastic soils of the Riverine Plain where subsoils with an ESP of 25-30 do not disperse unless remoulded (Blackmore 1976). Other anomalous results occur in a small minority of normal plastic soils in which dispersion will not occur even after remoulding in spite of an ESP much greater than 6 and a pHw as high as neutral. In at least some of these non-dispersive soils the typical sodic soil morphology is present, ie. a conspicuously bleached A2 horizon abruptly overlying a B2t horizon with prismatic or columnar structure, suggesting the low hydraulic conductivity expected of a sodic B horizon.""" ;

Although many soils exhibit gilgai microrelief, this feature is not used in their definition. Australia has the greatest area and diversity of cracking clay soils of any country in the world." ;

  rdfs:comment """In some clay soils it may be difficult to decide if sufficient cracks are present, or at the time of inspection the soil may be too moist to exhibit cracking. Also, in arid zone clay soils which commonly have high salt contents, the soil structure may be so fine and strong granular, or 'puffy', that it is difficult to decide if cracks are present or not. In such soils it is also obviously difficult to discern slickensides and/or lenticular peds. In yet other clay soils (up to 50% clay or more) cracks may develop but slickensides and/or lenticular peds are apparently not present.

Because cracking, slickensides and/or lenticular peds are essentially used as evidence to indicate shrink-swell behaviour, it is desirable that surrogate measurements be available if the morphological evidence is lacking or cannot be determined. See Vertic properties.""" ;

1.  A clay field texture or 35% or more clay throughout the solum except for thin, surface crusty horizons 30 mm or less thick and

3. Slickensides and/or lenticular peds occur at some depth in the solum. """ ;
