Although these soils do not occupy large areas in Australia, they are widely recognised and often intensively used because of their favourable physical properties. The most common forms have B2 horizons with strong polyhedral compound peds up to 10-15 mm, usually with smooth and often shiny faces. These break down readily to primary peds about 5 mm or less in size. However forms also occur with a very fine granular structure which may appear massive in place." ;

  rdfs:comment """This order is designed to accommodate a range of seasonally or permanently wet soils and thus there is some diversity within the order. The key criterion is saturation of the greater part of the profile for prolonged periods (2-3 months) in most years. The soils may or may not experience reducing conditions for all or part of the period of saturation, and thus manifestations of reduction and oxidation such as 'gley' colours and ochrous mottles may or may not be present.

Saturation by a water table may not necessarily be caused by low soil permeability. Often site drainage will be the most important factor, while in other well-known cases tidal influence is dominant. The relevant Field Handbook drainage classes are very poorly and poorly drained.

Several major classes of soils are excluded because it is considered their other profile characteristics are of greater significance than wetness. These are the Organosols, Podosols and Vertosols. Although some Hydrosols are dominated by organic materials (see Intertidal Hydrosols below), it is thought that because of their unique nature (ie. largely consisting of mangrove debris that is regularly inundated by saline tidal waters), it is more appropriate to classify them as organic Hydrosols rather than as a class of Organosols that occur in a mangrove environment.

The approach taken in this concept of 'wet' soils differs from more traditional usage in that reducing conditions are not emphasised. The rationale for the present approach is based on the assumption that saturation affects soil properties irrespective of whether or not reducing conditions are present. Obvious examples are those relating to certain physical and engineering properties, which result in limitations to the use of a soil eg. trafficability, etc.""" ;

The relevance of sodicity in strongly acid soils is open to question as in theory the presence of aluminium in such soils should counterbalance the usual deleterious effect of sodium (via dispersion) on soil physical properties. Unpublished data from many localities in Australia imply that for B horizons the critical limits of pH 5.5 and ESP of 6 to distinguish dispersive and non-dispersive soils seems to generally work in practice, although as might be expected, some soils do not behave as predicted. For this reason, sodicity is also used in Kurosols, but at a lower hierarchical level, to cater for those soils which have an ESP > 6 and may disperse in spite of having a pH less than 5.5. The role of the high exchangeable magnesium in many Kurosols is largely unknown.""" ;

Hydrosols are excluded on the basis that these will normally show some pedological development eg. mottling. A particular problem with the definition and subdivision of Rudosols is the difficulty in distinguishing between soil and 'non-soil', (see also 'What do we classify?'). In many instances they are classified on the basis of the nature of AC or C horizon materials or other substrates because these are the dominating features of the profile. It also follows that there may be difficulties in deciding if a soil is best classified as an Anthroposol or be regarded as an ‘anthropic’ Rudosol because the little-altered soil parent material may be human-made." ;
