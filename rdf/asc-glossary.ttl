  dcterms:description """This glossary does not attempt to define all morphological terms used in the classification. It mainly deals with those that are not defined in the Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook (NCST 2009). As the Field Handbook is currently being revised, some definitions in the glossary are aligned with the new Field Handbook rather than the current (third) edition.

Within this glossary, and throughout this website, the Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook is referred to as the Field Handbook (the Field Handbook is also colloquially known as the Yellow book due to the colour of its cover).

For clarity in this publication the levels in the classification are capitalised - e.g. Order, Suborder, Great Group, Subgroup and Family. This is not a requirement when using these terms outside of this publication.""" ;

They occur as sharply defined, horizontal to subhorizontal layers which are appreciably more clayey than the adjacent sandy or sandy loam soil material. Consistence strength is stronger, and colour is usually darker and redder or browner than the adjacent soil.

This use of the term 'argic' varies from its use in the World Reference Base (2015).

The most common known occurrences are in the mallee dune landscapes of Victoria-South Australia.""" ;

Horizon in which the dominant feature is one or more of the following:

An illuvial, residual or other concentration of silicate clay, iron, aluminium, carbonate, gypsum, manganese, or organic material, alone or in combination.
Maximum development of pedologic organisation as evidenced by a different structure and/or consistence, and/or stronger colours than the A horizon(s) above or any horizon immediately below.
In some shallow, stony soils B horizon material may only be present in fissures within the parent rock or saprolite. In such cases there should be 50% or more (visual abundance estimate) of B horizon material for it to qualify as a B horizon for the purposes of this classification (See also \"What do we classify\" and transitional horizons).

Note: A B1 horizon is a transitional horizon between A and B, which is dominated by properties characteristic of an underlying B2.""" ;
