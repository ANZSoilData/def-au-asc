Horizons may be difficult to name, but should be named in the field. Opinions formed at the time of description are useful for later reference.\nCracking clays\nThe A and B horizons in cracking clays are defined and recognised on the basis of structure rather than colour (McDonald 1977).\nThe A horizon in cracking clays may be structured or massive. The structural A horizon is the granular, subangular blocky, angular blocky or polyhedral surface horizon where ped faces are not accommodated and have irregular coarse voids between them. This is exemplified in soils with a self-mulching surface. The A horizon structure is unstable only in the sense that relatively rapid wetting and drying continually creates new peds and voids.\nThe B horizon is the coarse angular blocky and/or lenticular horizon where ped faces are all accommodated and usually have only narrow planar voids between them. The B horizon structure is stable because of relatively slow wetting and drying. The B horizon will usually occur within 200 mm of the surface, but the structural change must be confirmed using a spade or exposure to examine the soil. The boundary may often be gradual or diffuse, but can be clear or abrupt." ;

For example, a very permeable, coarse-textured soil occurring in a wet depression would have to be classed as very poorly drained. Hence there is a need to consider permeability, which refers to the potential of a soil to transmit water internally, and drainage, which refers to the rapidity and extent of water removal from the soil profile or site. Both these aspects of internal drainage may be difficult to assess in the field, and cannot be based solely on profile morphology. Mottling may, but not always, reflect drainage status, since mottling may be a relict feature. Vegetation and topography may be useful guides.\nThese concepts of permeability and drainage are largely based on Canada Soil Survey Committee (1978)." ;

        dct:description    "Grade of pedality is the degree of development and distinctness of peds. In virtually all material that has structure, the surface of individual peds will differ in some way from the interior of peds. The degree of development expresses the relative difference between the strength of cohesion within peds and the strength of adhesion between adjacent peds. Determination of grade of structure in the field depends on the proportion of peds that hold together as entire peds when displaced and also on the ease with which the soil separates into discrete peds. Grade of pedality varies with the soil water status. It is important to record the soil water status of the described profile, and it is desirable that the grade of pedality be described at the soil water status most common for the horizon." ;

Even though a layer below material 3, for example, is similar to material 2, it is designated 4 in the sequence (see Profiles C and D in Figure 13). Discrimination of lithological discontinuities from soil horizon boundaries will depend in each case upon the degree of pedological organisation and the contrast between lithological units (see, for example, Profiles C and D in Figure 13).\nWhere lithologic discontinuities are suspected in the profile but there is no clear evidence, either the numeric prefix should not be used or a query should be added to indicate doubt.
