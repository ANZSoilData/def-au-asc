Where slope classes have been obtained by systematic sampling, define the classes using equal increments on a scale of the logarithm of the slope tangent, a procedure intended to normalise frequency distributions of observed slope (Speight 1971). Where the most common slope class is estimated by direct observation, it is thought that the estimate will compare with that calculated using the log-normal model.
Modal slope class determines the use of certain adjectives applied to landform patterns that are characterised by alternating crests and depressions. These are: rolling for moderate modal slopes (10–32%); undulating for gentle slopes (3–10%); and gently undulating for very gentle slopes (1–3%) (compare with Soil Survey Staff 1951, pages 161–165). The other slope classes, precipitous, very steep, steep and level, are to be applied as they stand. The terminology for simple erosional landform patterns based on relief and modal slope is given in Table 5.
Table 5 defines the category badlands by various combinations of high slope values and low relief values. These combinations imply extremely close spacing of streams or valleys. Specifically, if one assumes a sawtooth terrain profile, the valley spacing implied is less than 100 m in areas with 50 m relief and less than 30 m in areas with 5 m relief; these values appear to accord with usage.
Table 7 lists types of landform pattern in order of their typical class of modal slope. This table should not be regarded as definitive, for slope within each type of landform pattern may vary widely."""@en ;

  rdfs:comment """Gradational activities are those that tend to reduce the land to a common elevation by removing material from higher places and depositing it in lower places (Chamberlin and Salisbury 1904, page 2), without necessarily reducing the angle of slope at every point. The work of streams and landslides is almost entirely in the gradational modes. However, this tendency is opposed by many processes that commonly act in an anti-gradational mode. These modes are characteristic of volcanism, diastrophism and various kinds of human and biological activity.
However, many engineering works involve erosion and aggradation because these gradational modes use less energy than anti-gradational modes. For the same reason, erosion and aggradation may easily be induced unintentionally by land use (pages 92–96).
To judge the mode of geomorphological activity responsible for a given landform element, the observer must visualise a former surface that has suffered distortion, burial or removal of material, and seek evidence that such activity has taken place. (Information on soil and substrate materials relevant to this investigation should be recorded as specified in other sections.)
Allow for the recording of more than one mode of activity, together with options concerning geomorphological agents.""" ;

Evaluate the slope over an interval of 20 m, straddling the point of soil observation. Always observe and record the slope as precisely as the chosen survey method permits. The observation should span no less than 20 m so as not to be influenced too much by features of the microrelief that occurs within the landform element." ;
