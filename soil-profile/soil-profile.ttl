  dct:description "Water is removed from the soil rapidly in relation to supply. Excess water flows downward rapidly if underlying material is highly permeable. There may be rapid subsurface lateral flow during heavy rainfall provided there is a steep gradient. Soils are usually coarse-textured, or shallow, or both. No horizon is normally wet for more than several hours after water addition." ;

  skos:definition "Permeability is independent of climate and drainage, and – as applied to a soil – is controlled by the potential to transmit water (saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks) of the least permeable layer in the soil. Therefore it is inferred from attributes of the soil such as structure, texture, porosity, cracks and shrink–swell properties. The rate of transmission of water in the profile is based on the assumption that loss by evapotranspiration is minimal. The Ks ranges are compatible with those of Nowland in Canada, as reported by McKeague et al. (1982)."^^xsd:string ;
