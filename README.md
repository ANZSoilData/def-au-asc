# def-au-asc

The Australian Soil Classification (3rd edn 2021) provides a framework for organising knowledge about Australian soils by allocating soils to classes via a key. 

This repository is for the preparation and maintenance of a machine-readable representation of:
- The ASC ontology (OWL representation) of https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/catalog/8558027
- The Glossary of terms referenced by the ASC (SKOS representation)

- (https://anzsoildata.github.io/def-au-asc/) is a machine and human readable ontology for ASC, referencing the glossary
- Discoverable through Research Vocabularies Australia (RVA)
