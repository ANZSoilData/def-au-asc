  skos:definition "Permeability is independent of climate and drainage, and – as applied to a soil – is controlled by the potential to transmit water (saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks) of the least permeable layer in the soil. Therefore it is inferred from attributes of the soil such as structure, texture, porosity, cracks and shrink–swell properties. The rate of transmission of water in the profile is based on the assumption that loss by evapotranspiration is minimal. The Ks ranges are compatible with those of Nowland in Canada, as reported by McKeague et al. (1982)." ;

Structure may vary, but cracks or spaces between peds when dry close on wetting. Texture is usually clay or silty clay, and there are no pores visible (with a hand lens) that could conduct water when wet." ;
